# Ecommerce_BackendAPI
Creating backend API for a small Ecommerce site

## Code Description
This application uses Node.js, Express, mySQL, and Sequelize in order to simulate a backend server for an E-commerce application. Using API routes, a user can GET all the information from a table (including the foreign keys) or on a single item, create a new item through a POST, update an item with PUT, or DELETE an item.
